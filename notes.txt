General:
    What React?
        JS library that acts like a framework
        Devved by FaceBook
    Why React?
        front-end JS easier to use (the JS renders the view by returning html)
        Interactive UIs
        Extremely Modular
            easy to work on in teams (minimal toe stepping)
            easy to update piecewise
        virtual DOM
    Prerequisites:
        JavaScript
        Classes, Destructureing, Higher order array methods (forEach, Map, filter)
        arrow functions
        fetch API & promises

State:
    an object that determines how a component renders and behaves
    application level state via Reux or React's context API
    can have conditional styling based on state - change component's state, change the component, e.g. if(post.state.isFeatured){css: background color: red} or something like that

Getting started: (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md)
    npm install create-react-app -g
    (from the directory where you want to store your react app):
    create-react-app 'appName'
    ... (takes a few min)
    npm start (kicks off the dev server and previews in browser)
    get coding! - this gives a boilerplate

Styling:
    styled elements:
        const customElement = styled.div`***{Custom Styling e.g. color: red,}***` 
            // can add &'s to increase specificity (each & re-add the class) so, customElement = styled.div`&&&{color:red}` == .CustomElement-asdf123.CustomElement-asdf123.CustomElement-asdf123 {color: red}
        <customElement css="inline stylings"/>
            // Looks like my style object overwrites onload inline styles
        <element style={styleObject} || style={{color: "red"}}? />
            styleObject = {backgroundColor: 'yellow', color: 'blue', ...}

Caveats:
    cannot use class attribute in JSX, instead use className="" (unless you're using react V16+...)
    component files should be in CapitalCase (PascalCase?)
    component classes have a mandatory render method that returns jsx.
    make components quickly & easily w/ es7 react - 
    should use arrow functions for component methods as they bind this automatically
        someFunction(e){this is undefined} unless this.someFunction.bind(this)
        alternatively:
        someFunction = (e)=>{this is already the this of the event}
    w/o redux or stateAPI, need to manually climb the dom tree - pass functions via component properties to reach the state you're affecting if it is a higher state, also need to pass any/all pertinent data up the tree
    see destructureing example in todoitem.js render method 
    can use <React.Fragment><h1>Header</h1><p>sometext</p></React.Fragment> instead of an encapsulation element if you don't want all your components elements in a container
    see routing on app.js - import BrowserRouter from react-router-dom (there may be a more modern way to do this?), access to BrowserRouter, Route, Link
