General:
    What React?
        JS library that acts like a framework
        Devved by FaceBook
    Why React?
        front-end JS easier to use (the JS renders the view by returning html)
        Interactive UIs
        Extremely Modular
            easy to work on in teams (minimal toe stepping)
            easy to update piecewise
        virtual DOM
    Prerequisites:
        JavaScript
        Classes, Destructureing, Higher order array methods (forEach, Map, filter)
        arrow functions
        fetch API & promises

State:
    an object that determines how a component renders and behaves
    application level state via Reux or React's context API
    can have conditional styling based on state - change component's state, change the component, e.g. if(post.state.isFeatured){css: background color: red} or something like that

Getting started: (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md)
    npm install create-react-app -g
    (from the directory where you want to store your react app):
    create-react-app 'appName'
    ... (takes a few min)
    npm start (kicks off the dev server and previews in browser)
    get coding! - this gives a boilerplate

Caveats:
    cannot use class attribute in JSX, instead use className="" (unless you're using react V16+...)
    component files should be in CapitalCase (PascalCase?)
    component classes have a mandatory render method that returns jsx.
